  Our project is a blockchain written purely in OCaml. Users can create wallets, 
  mine blocks, view transactions, and observe the ledger. Big Red Blockchain is 
  extensible, transparent, and secure. Our application can support countless 
  real-world applications like decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens, and 
  smart contracts.
